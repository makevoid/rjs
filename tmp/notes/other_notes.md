### Purpose

A bit of context...

Why the !#@** I'm doing this?

The perception of Ruby is at one of the highest lows because of things like are essentially slowly "eating" rails as ruby, we will come out of a Ruby-Rails (- ActiveSupport, ActiveRecord & friends) - Rails vs Merb merge was a bit of a failure, we lost a lot of merb cool things - Merb and DataMapper were much better than rails but no one noticed because of omakase
